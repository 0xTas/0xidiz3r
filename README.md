Batch technique: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RADvfJysuA<br>

Powershell technique (todo!()): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJlqQYyzGi8<br>


### Usage<br>

`cargo run`<br>

The program will prompt you for a batch command or path to a batch script.<br>

Then, a script named "obfuscated.bat" will be created in the current directory.<br>

The contents of .\obfuscated.bat is functionally equivalent to your source command/script.
